# Code for the tutorials of 'Foundation: Introduction to LangGraph' course for MAT496 Monsoon 2025

## Module 1 Lesson 1: Motivation
Since there is no code for this lesson, I have not attached any links here.

An LLM is limited. It doesn't have access to tools, mutli step workflows, external context etc. We want LLMs to choose and pick their own control flows (or chains) depending on the problem that they face. An agent is a control flow defined by an LLM.

Langgraphs job is to give more control to the agent, while maintaining reilability. Langraph features: Persistence, Streaming, Human in the loop, Controllability.
